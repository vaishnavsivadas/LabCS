        <h2 id="before">What Is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong> is a code injection attack in which an adversary inserts 
            malicious code within a legitimate website. The code then launches as an infected script 
            in the user’s web browser, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information or impersonate the user.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Web forums, message boards, blogs, and other websites that allow users to post their content are the most 
            susceptible to XSS attacks. Unless the input is reviewed, verified, and encoded by the web application, 
            any malicious script included in the code will automatically run by other users’ browsers. 
            This script can then access the user’s cookies, session tokens, or alternative sensitive information 
            retained by the browser and used on that site. It is even possible for these scripts to rewrite the infected 
            web page’s content in more advanced attacks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 id="before">How Does Cross Site Scripting Work?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is important to note that XSS attack’s mechanics will vary based on the type of attack being deployed. 
            That said, most attacks follow the same process:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p style="padding: 30px;font-size: 18px; width:fit-content; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); margin: 25px; border-color: #0b1b5b; border-radius: 5px;">
                &lt;BODY&gt; BACKGROUND = "javascript:alert('XSS')" &gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>1.</strong> The attacker identifies a place and method for which to inject malicious code into a web page. 
            For this to be possible, the website must allow users to add content to the page through comments, 
            posts, or contact fields.If the attacker has a defined target, they will employ social engineering tactics, 
            including phishing and spoofing techniques to encourage the user to visit the site in question. Otherwise, 
            the code is left for any user to discover.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>2.</strong> The victim visits the website with the injected code. Their device will accept and execute the infected
            script because it considers it part of the source code from a trusted site. Given that the code is not 
            visible and most internet users do not understand common programming languages, such as JavaScript, 
            it is difficult for the average user to detect XSS attacks.

<!--Phishing-->>
<section class="post_content">
    <div class="container" style="margin: 15px; width: fit-content;" id="content2">
        <h2 id="before">What is Phishing ?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Phishing is when cybercriminals send fake messages or create fake websites 
            that seem real to trick you into giving them your private information, 
            like passwords or credit card details. They pretend to be trustworthy sources, 
            like banks or companies, to steal your sensitive data and use it for bad purposes. 
            Always be careful and verify before sharing personal info online.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="phishing_image">
            <img src="images/extra/phishing.png">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Certainly! Here's an example of phishing:
            <br><br>
            Imagine you receive an email that looks like it's from your bank. 
            The email claims that there's a security issue with your account and urges you to 
            click on a link to update your login information to secure your account.
            <br><br>
            
            The email might say something like:
            <br><br>
            <div style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); width: fit-content; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">
            <strong>Dear Customer,</strong>
            <br><br><br>
            We have noticed some unusual activity on your bank account. To ensure the security of your account, please click on the link below to verify your information.
            <br><br>
            <strong>[Click here to verify your account]</strong>
            <br><br>
            Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Your Bank
            <br>
            </div>
            
            <p>However, if you carefully examine the email, you might notice some red flags:
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. **Generic Greeting:**</strong>The email starts with "Dear Customer" instead of addressing you by your name.
            <br><br>
            <strong>2. **Urgent Tone:**</strong> The email creates a sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly without thinking.
            <br><br>
            <strong>3. **Suspicious Link:**</strong> The link provided doesn't lead to the bank's official website. Hovering over the link (without clicking) might reveal a different website address.
            <br><br>
            <strong>4. **Unusual Sender Address:**</strong> The sender's email address might look slightly off or not match the bank's official domain.
            <br><br>
            If you were to click on the link and enter your login information, you could inadvertently provide your username and password to the attackers. They could then use this information to gain access to your bank account and potentially steal your money or commit other fraudulent activities.
            In this example, the attackers are using phishing tactics by posing as your bank to trick you into revealing sensitive information. It's important to always verify the authenticity of such emails by contacting the organization directly using contact information you find on their official website.

    <div class="container" style="margin: 15px; width: fit-content;" id="content3">
        <h2 id="before">SQL Injection?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in an application's input validation 
            to execute unauthorized SQL queries. It occurs when user inputs are not properly sanitized before being used in database 
            queries, allowing attackers to manipulate these inputs to gain unauthorized access to the database or perform other malicious 
            actions.
        </p>

                SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
                <br>
                SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
                <br>
                SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="before">How SQL Injection Works?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>Input:</strong>Web applications often take user inputs, like forms, search boxes, or URLs, and use them in SQL queries to interact with a database.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Lack of Sanitization:</strong>If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize these inputs, attackers can inject malicious SQL code into them.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Manipulating Queries:</strong> Attackers insert SQL commands into input fields to manipulate the application's SQL queries. This can lead to unintended actions like unauthorized access, data leakage, or even modifying or deleting data.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Suppose a website has a login form:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); width: fit-content; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&lt;input_username&gt;' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';</p>
        <br>
        <p >If the application doesn't sanitize input correctly, an attacker could input ' OR '1'='1 as the username and ' OR '1'='1 as the password. The modified query would become:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); width: fit-content; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';</p>

        <p>SQL injection is a serious threat that can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access. Proper input validation, using prepared statements, and staying informed about secure coding practices are crucial for preventing these attacks.</p>

            Nikto is a popular open-source web server scanner used to discover various vulnerabilities on web servers. 
            It's often used for security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in web applications 
            and server configurations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In Kali Linux, Nikto is pre-installed and can be used from the command line. Here's a basic example of how to use Nikto:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps to perform nikto tool in Kali Linux</strong>
            <br><br>
            1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
            <br><br>
            2. Use the following command to scan a target website: Replace &lt;target-website&gt; with the actual URL of the website you want to scan.
            <strong><p>nikto -h &lt;target-website&gt;</p></strong>
            <br>    
        <p>Nikto will start scanning the target website and display the results in the terminal. It will provide information about potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues.</p>
