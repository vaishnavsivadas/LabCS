<!--Keylogger Attack-->>

        <h2 id="before">Keylogger Attack</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A keylogger attack, also known as keystroke logging, is a type of cyber attack in which malicious software or hardware is used to record keystrokes made on a computer or other input device. 
            This attack allows cybercriminals to capture sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, 
            credit card numbers, and other confidential data, as the victim types it into the compromised device.
            <br><br>

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Physical devices are attached to the victim's computer or input device (such as a keyboard). These devices record keystrokes before they even reach the operating system, making them difficult to detect through software scans. Hardware keyloggers may be attached between the keyboard cable and the computer's USB port or embedded within the keyboard itself.

<!--USB Drop attack-->>
<section class="post_content">
    <div class="container" style="margin: 15px; width: fit-content;" id="content2">
        <h2 id="before">USB Drop attack</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The USB drop attack falls under the category of client-side attacks within the realm of system hacking. 
            This method requires the attacker's physical proximity to the target, enabling them to insert a malicious 
            USB device into the victim's computer and initiate the attack. This approach is often exploited by 
            cybercriminals to illicitly access data, introduce malware into a susceptible PC, or even execute 
            ransomware on the victim's system. 
            <br><br>
            The attack manifests through various vectors, including infected 
            CDs/DVDs, inserted SD cards, or even activated Bluetooth connections, triggering automatic malware 
            downloads onto the victim's computer during synchronization with another nearby device.

        <h2 id="before">How a USB Drop Attack Works</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            USB Drop attack is used for remotely taking control or snooping into other devices by misguiding a user. Let's see how it works:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Planting the USB Device </strong><br> 
            The attacker leaves a USB device, often disguised as an innocuous object like a flash drive, 
            in a place where it's likely to be found. This could be in a public area, parking lot, or even 
            inside an organization's premises.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Social Engineering </strong><br> 
            The attacker may label the USB device with tempting labels like "Confidential Information," "Salary Details," or 
            something that piques curiosity. This encourages users to plug the USB device into their 
            computers to see what's on it.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Malicious Payload </strong><br> 
            The USB device is loaded with malware, such as a keylogger, ransomware, or backdoor Trojan. 
            As soon as the user connects the USB device to their computer, the malware is executed.
            <br><br>
            <strong>infection </strong><br> 
            The malware gains access to the victim's system and may carry out various malicious activities, 
            depending on the type of payload. For example, a keylogger could record keystrokes, while ransomware 
            could encrypt files and demand payment for decryption.
